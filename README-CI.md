## Docker Configuration Detailing 
* To install docker on wsl-ubuntu, I added a resource on docker desktop. I downloaded docker desktop from the [dockers installation website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/wsl/) that downloads it on the backend of Windows. Once docker desktop is downloaded, I signed in to my personal account and accessed Settings->Resource->WSL 2 integration->Apply and Restart.
* To build and configure a container without building an image I used the docker run command
  * The command come with options to configure how the container runs.
